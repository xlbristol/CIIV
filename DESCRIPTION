Title: The Confidence Interval Method for Selecting Valid Instrumental Variables.

Description: An implementation of the confidence interval (CI) downward testing procedure 
    based on the Sargan/Hansen-J test for overidentifying restrictions. The algorithm 
    selects the valid instrumental variables from a set of potential instruments that may 
    contain invalid ones. It also provides post-selection IV estimation for the causal 
    effect of the treatment/exposure on the outcome.
